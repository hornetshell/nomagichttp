# NoMagicHTTP

NoMagicHTTP is an asynchronous server-side Java library used to receive HTTP
requests and respond to them.

The NoMagicHTTP library strives to offer an elegant and powerful API that is
just about as fast and scalable as any fully JDK-based HTTP server
implementation could possibly be.

Best of all, this library is designed around the firmly held opinion that all
forms of magic are evil. Annotations and "beans" will never be a part of the
library, only developer joy and productivity.

**WARNING: This project is fresh out of the oven and probably not very useful at
the moment. Please become an early contributor and join the fight to rid the
world of magic!**

## Getting started

The intent of this project is to be primarily documented through javadoc of an
API that is _discoverable_ and intuitive. A good start to read is the
[package-info.java](src/main/java/alpha/nomagichttp/package-info.java) file of
`alpha.nomagichttp`.

The following examples will assume that Java 11+ is installed and the current
working directory is the NoMagicHTTP project root.
